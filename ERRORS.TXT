DESIGN ERRORS
=============

* all 6 MMBT2222A have their Emitter and Base swapped (wrong footprint)
* R4 smaller or/and C6 smaller (1/3 the time constant) -> R4=100k, R6=100k
* -> R5 = 1k to avoid self-start
* 4.7 uF cap in parallel to battery missing
* pull-up resistors for sound modules
* put the two opto transitors in series
