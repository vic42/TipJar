# TipJar
Vienna Repair Cafe talking tip jar

This is a talking tip jar design that is able to differentiate between coins and bills to utter two different spoken, sung or screamed messages accordingly.

It is a Lo-Fi approach meant to reduce cost as well as programming effort in order to get it done and ultimately keep it easily reproducible.

Feel free to use and/or comment.
